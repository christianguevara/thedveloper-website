Once Soccer was my first native mobile application while I was doing freelance work for the company AppTouch. Initially it took 3 months, after the initial version we continued the consultancy process and deveopment during a couple of years including improvements continuosly.

The application was in the **first place** in the free sports apps category, developed to support **3 languages**.

In 2019 a full redesign was launched, reusing all the structure we already built.

It was a pleasure to work with [Mauro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauroascazubi/) (SANMIGUEL - DIGITAL & BRAND AGENCY en MÃ¼nchen) and [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcueva/) (Cloud Solutions Architect at Google) in this project and receive constant feedback.

Actually because of legal reasons not related to me, the app is not receiving updates :(
