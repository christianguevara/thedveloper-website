After months (years) of planning to write blog entries and feeling frustrated about not doing it, here I am. One article at a time.

**What changed?**

The way I view the content I create - from a perspective of making it truly mine rather than from a "marketing" viewpoint.
These ideas came mainly from [ðŸŒ± My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) by Joel Hooks
and [Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) by Tom Critchlow.

It's interesting how different perspectives can make you rethink your goals for a certain "product" -in this case-, myself and my personal brand. After all:

**Who am I?**

Beyond titles, positions, and achievements, I'm an individual, a human being just like you (unless you are a robot ðŸ¤–).
If you want to know more about me in a professional way, you can read my [About](/about) page.

I believe in **"wabi-sabi"** from an engineering perspective because, after all, that's how we are as individuals - full of that beauty that's _imperfect,
impermanent, and incomplete_; just like this website and the universe itself.
