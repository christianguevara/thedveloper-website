## What is connect 4 ?

Connect 4 is a classic two-player game where players take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertical grid.
The goal is to be the first player to form a line of 4 tokens either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game mechanics are straightforward:

1. The game board is a 7x7 grid that starts empty
2. Players take turns selecting a column to drop their token
3. The token falls to the lowest empty position in that column
4. A player wins by connecting 4 of their tokens in a line:
   - Horizontally (left to right)
   - Vertically (up and down) 
   - Diagonally (at a 45 degree angle)
5. If the board fills up with no winner, the game is a draw

The key challenge in implementing Connect 4 is efficiently:

- Managing the game state (board representation)
- Handling token placement and gravity
- Detecting winning combinations
- Validating moves (full columns, out of bounds)
- Switching between players

Let's look at how we can implement this in code...

## The coding challenge

The challenge starts with the following "base" code.

We need to implement: `play`, `checkWinner` and `print`, actually `print` is more like a helper.
For sure we can implement more methods or properties if needed.

```js
/**
Connect4

Connect4 is a game where two players take turns placing a token on columns that drop to the bottom.
When a player forms 4 of his tokens in a line - horizontally, vertically,or diagonally - the player wins.

Implement Connect 4 with the class below.
*/

export const PLAYER_ONE = 1
export const PLAYER_TWO = 2

export class Connect4 {
  constructor() {}
  play(col) {}
  checkWinner() {}
  print() {}
}
```

## Implementation
### Initialize the board

We need to keep track of some stuff like the board, the current player and the winner.
We can add the properties at class level.

```js
export class Connect4 {
  board;
  currentPlayer;
  winner;
  
  constructor() {}
}
```

Then we need to create a base board where we have the "slots" so the "chip" or token can fall in. In this case is the player number.

As you already imagined, we will work with 2D arrays. Something like.

<div className="w-full sm:max-w-1/2 mx-auto border-primary-300">
|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 1 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 2 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 3 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 4 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 5 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| 6 | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
</div>

So then we need to create the initial array with arrays (2D array).
I made a mistake when using the [fill()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/fill) method.
The error is pointed in code with a comment.

I was not able to see it at first but once I realized it was so obvious 😅.

Also `currentPlayer` is initialized.

```js
constructor() {
    // ❌ Same array reference to all positions in the first array
    // this.board = Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(""));

    // Init the board
    this.board = Array(BOARD_SIZE)
      .fill(null)
      .map(() => Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(""));
    
    this.currentPlayer = PLAYER_ONE;
  }
```

### The play method



### Using .table() to print a nice looking board

### The difficult part of checkWinner()
